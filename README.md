## About
The [PokeScript project](https://github.com/lillapulay/pokedex-javascript) upgraded using jQuery and Bootstrap as part of CareerFoundry's Full-Stack Web Development course.
The app loads data from an external API, displays each object on a separate button and shows further details in a modal.

This project was my first time using JavaScript libraries. The layout and functionality is almost exactly the same as that of the original, vanilla JavaScript version, but it uses different tools as its backbone. You can see the hosted website [here](https://lillapulay.github.io/jquery-pokedex/).

Besides fulfilling the task requirements, I also gave the styling a boost by creating consistent theme colors and shapes, and the project got showcased amongst student submissions in the corresponding lecture. 

## Planned updates:
- [x] Styling updates (background, modal, favicon, font)
- [x] Use different background images on L and S screens
- [ ] Search bar, possibly a 'sort' function
- [ ] 'Back to top' button
- [ ] Loading indicator
- [ ] Error handling and error messages (e.g. offline mode)
- [ ] Replace logo
- [ ] Scrollbar
- [ ] Hide button outline ('X' button on modal)
